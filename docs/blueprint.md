# **App Name**: VelocityGo

## Core Features:

- Tabbed Service Selection: Implement a tabbed interface similar to Uber/Lyft, allowing users to switch between 'Rides' and other services like 'Eats'.
- Location Search Bar: Design a prominent search bar labeled 'Where to?' with a clean and easily accessible design for location input.
- Recent Locations Display: Display recent locations with recognizable icons and clear labeling (address, city, state) for quick selection.
- Service Suggestions Grid: Offer a grid of 'Suggestions' or service options (Ride, 2-Wheels, Rental Cars, Reserve) with rounded cards and relevant icons.
- Bottom Navigation Bar: Incorporate a bottom navigation bar with icons and labels for primary app sections (Home, Services, Activity, Account).

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a predominantly light color scheme (e.g., white or light gray) for the background to provide a clean and modern look.
- Employ a contrasting color (e.g., a shade of gray) for the search bar and other interactive elements to make them easily identifiable.
- Use a clear and readable sans-serif font for all text elements to ensure legibility.
- Employ simple, consistent icons for navigation and service options. Icons should be easily understandable at a glance.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout with sufficient padding around elements to prevent visual clutter.
